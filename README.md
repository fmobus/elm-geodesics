Elm implementation of geographic coordinates Latitude/Longitude for elm

The implementation of this library is based on the work of Chris Veness[1], who converted
the haversine elliptical formulae into javascript, and also on the work of Peter Haldb√¶k[2],
who implemented the javascript mt-latlon library.
