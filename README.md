Elm implementation of geographic coordinates Latitude/Longitude for elm

The implementation of this library is based on the work of [Chris Veness](http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html), who converted
the haversine elliptical formulae into javascript, and also on the work of [Peter Haldb√¶k](https://github.com/peterhaldbaek/mt-latlon),
who implemented the javascript mt-latlon library.
